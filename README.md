# Vue Todo List CRUD app
This is a Vue todo list app that uses axios and json placeholder to showcase a todolist. 

## Future Improvements
- [x] Use a material framework such as Vuetify or Buefy to make it more visually pleasing
- Connect to a backend so that data persists, good chance to try out Deno
- [x] Add some animation for add and page load
- Add login so that people can create their own account
- Basic analytics (total todo's, clear all, completed todo's)
- Drag and drop 
- Priority setter
- Dates
