    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <br />
      <p>This started out as my first Vue project ever had a very plain style as shown below</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <v-img :src="image" alt="screenshot" class="img" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>I have used this as an example app to learn Vuetify, transitions, and will eventually create a Deno backend to support it. Some ambitions down the pipline including login, statistics, dates, etc. I am not trying to create a groundbreaking new app, i just want to showcase what i can build.</p>
